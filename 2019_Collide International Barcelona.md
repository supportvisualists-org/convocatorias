CERN and the city of Barcelona are proud to launch Collide International residency award as part of a 3-years collaboration
 

Arts at CERN and the city of Barcelona are proud to launch a joint collaboration through the Collide International residency award. For the coming three years (2019-2021), the Laboratory art’s programme and the city of Barcelona will be joining forces to bring the dialogue between art and science to the highest level. As a new partnership that will take place during the next three years, CERN and the city of Barcelona will co-host the leading art and science residency award, Collide International.

Collide International, the flagship cultural programme of Arts at CERN, was created in 2012 to foster creative thinking and to encourage curiosity about the fundamental nature of our world.  Within this new collaboration framework, every year a three-month residency will be announced and awarded to an artist to extend her/his research at CERN by working together with particle physicists, engineers, IT experts and laboratory staff. Following this, the artist will be hosted for one month at Barcelona’s Fabra i Coats Art Factory, where he/she will be able to expand her/his research, test ideas and engage with the scientific and artistic communities of the city.

Barcelona is a vibrant city that combines an innovative and artistic tradition with the most advanced scientific research, and leads the emergence of new artistic expression that goes beyond the traditional art disciplines. Arts at CERN fosters experimentation through the arts in connection with fundamental research. Now, the first Open Call for Entries is announced and artists from any part of the world can submit a proposal for a residency and an art production at these combined locations. Through a residency period split between Geneva and Barcelona, Collide International aims to inspire experimental thinking across the arts and science. Ultimately, Collide International calls for new artistic approaches to a deep and critical understanding of art and science collaborations, and for challenging new modes of dialogue and enquiry across disciplines in connection with society.

# Criteria of the Call for Entries

Collide International/ Barcelona is the annual international competition that invites artists of any nationality or age to apply for a 3-month residency award by submitting a proposal . Collide International calls upon interested artists to join an extraordinary scientific community that is creativity-driven.

Artists interested in applying to Collide International/ Barcelona are invited to submit a single proposal that reflects upon encounters between art and science, and offers challenging methods of collaboration and enquiry between artists and scientists at CERN during a 2-month residency at CERN and a 1-month residency at Fabra i Coats Art Factory in Barcelona.

The scope of this proposal should consider both a research phase at CERN as well as a second developmental phase in Barcelona, where the artists will have the opportunity to expand their research and develop a production in connection with Barcelona’s scientific and cultural network, as well as to engage with a wide range of communities. The ultimate goal for the residency will be the research and development of new concepts within fundamental research contexts and in connection with societal concepts.

The Collide International Open Call for Entries encourages the participation of artists interested in the ideas described above and complying with any of the following:

- Artists interested in the cultural significance of fundamental research and scientific knowledge.                            

- Artists engaging with an innovative discourse on contemporary culture, following ambitious standards of creativity.

- Artists interested in the processes of fundamental science and particle physics at CERN who are able to extrapolate this understanding into projects of artistic excellence.

- Artists interested in the community-driven centre Fabra i Coats- Barcelona and in the interaction with the urban area and its social fabric.

- Artists pushing the traditional forms of collaboration between art and science, and asking innovative and provocative questions in this respect.

- Artists approaching science and research from diverse angles of enquiry, philosophical, ethical, technological or sociological perspectives.

Collide International encourages the participation of mid-career artists as well as emergent artists with no distinction according to age or origin.
