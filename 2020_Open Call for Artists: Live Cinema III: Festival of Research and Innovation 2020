# OPEN CALL
Building on the successes of the Live Cinema Conference held at Kingâ€™s College London in 2016 and the Live Cinema Summit at Sheffield Doc/Fest 2018, the Live Cinema Festival of Research and Innovation 2020 will address artistic and technological advances in the field of live cinema: film screenings augmented through live or immersive elements, including site-specific locations, technological intervention and digital participation. This festival will profile the growing prominence of live cinema phenomena within the global film experience economy and will highlight contemporary artistic and technological innovation as well as situating these current phenomena within their appropriate historical contexts.

The festival will take place over 4 days in the week commencing 18th May and will feature cutting edge academic research, master classes, workshops, a programme of screenings, Q&A sessions and world premieres of exclusive live events.

Drawing on the format established in the innovative and highly successful Live Cinema Talent Pool 2017 â€“ 2018 and Live Cinema Summit 2018 we will also be recruiting new artist associates to participate in a series of development activities and workshops starting in March 2020. The associate artist process will challenge the increasingly popular notion that the future of film spectatorship will be dominated by digitally enabled home viewing and streaming, and will instead explore the possibilities provided by the cutting-edge innovations in Live Cinema Production and Exhibition that respond to audiencesâ€™ increasing desire for live and collective cinematic experiences.


# What you get:

Workshops
Up to 5 selected artists will be invited to participate in a professional development opportunity through bespoke workshops and mentoring with Live Cinema UK and expert speakers across a variety of sectors, promoting collaboration and creativity, addressing challenges in the sector including logistics, legal and licensing issues, diversity and audience development.

Finishing fund
Associate Artists will then be invited to pitch ideas for new live cinema works to be presented either as a scratch performance, preview or world premiere at the Live Cinema Festival of Research and Innovation in May 2020. Between 1 and 3 projects will receive funding of between Â£500-Â£2000 from a total pot of Â£5000 to develop or finish works in production which will be premiered in May 2020 at the Live Cinema Festival where you will perform in front of a public audience alongside an international audience of cinema, festival and arts programmers.

Festival pass
Each Associate Artist regardless of whether they are selected for the finishing fund will receive a full festival pass to all the workshops and sessions scheduled as part of the Live Cinema Festival of Research and Innovation taking place in Nottingham in May 2020

Six months as official Associate Artist for Live Cinema UK
All Associate Artists will be offered the opportunity to develop touring and funding models with mentoring by Lisa Brook at Live Cinema UK in order to support the enhancement of existing projects and to collaborate on new funded projects as they arise. We envisage artists having a long-term relationship with Live Cinema UK who have festivals and venues around the world seeking new touring work, so the ability and willingness to tour and work with Live Cinema UK on an ongoing basis would be essential for all applicants.

Associate Artist places will be limited and applicants will be selected by the Live Cinema Steering Group via the criteria below.
What weâ€™re looking for:

We are interested in all artforms and welcome applications from musicians, audiovisual performers, theatrical and dance companies working in any genre as long as there is a film/multimedia element, including but not limited to live soundtracks, theatrical interventions, audiovisual performance. If you are unsure whether your art form is applicable, please get in touch: weâ€™re open to ideas.
